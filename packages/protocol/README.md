This module aims to add a protocol-like patterns to JavaScript like you can found in Swift, Rust, Haskell. Here, a protocol is just a set of unique symbols which is supposed to be used later to check that a given protocol is implemented for a JS object. Since symbols are unique it also allow multiple inheritance via the `deriving` symbol.

## Usage
